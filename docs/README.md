# AtlasXConnection Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction
AtlasXConnection is a unified platform that uses artificial intelligence to optimize public network management in critical areas such as policy and procurement, network design and planning, and resource allocation.

## 2. System Architecture
### 2.1 Main Components
- **Frontend**: User interface developed with Streamlit.
- **Backend**: Business logic and data processing in Python.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **AI Models**: IBM Granite Models for analysis and predictions.

## 3. Installation and Configuration
### 3.1 Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python 3.8
- PostgreSQL

### 3.2 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_user/AtlasXConnection.git
cd AtlasXConnection
```

2. Build and run the Docker container:
```sh
docker build -t atlasxconnection .
docker run -p 8501:8501 atlasxconnection
```

### 3.3 Configuration
Set the environment variables in `src/config.py`:

- `IBM_PROJECT_ID`
- `DB_NAME`
- `DB_USER`
- `DB_PASSWORD`
- `DB_HOST`
- `DB_PORT`

## 4. Integration
### 4.1 Integration with IBM Watson
Set up IBM Watson credentials in `src/config.py` and use the IBM Watson SDK to perform inference and model tuning.

### 4.2 Integration with PostgreSQL
Use the [`psycopg2`](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) module to connect and run queries against the PostgreSQL database.

## 5. Project Operation
### 5.1 Policy and Procurement Module
- **Main Function**: `analyze_procurements` in `src/procurements.py`
- **Description**: Analyzes procurement data and provides recommendations using the Granite model.

### 5.2 Design and Planning Module
- **Main Function**: `simulate_network` and `predict_maintenance` in `src/planning.py`
- **Description**: Simulates network scenarios and predicts maintenance needs using the Granite model.

### 5.3 Resource Allocation Module
- **Main Function**: `assign_resources` in `src/resources.py`
- **Description**: Allocates resources optimally using the Granite model.
